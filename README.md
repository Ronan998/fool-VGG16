# Fooling Convolutional Neural Networks

This jupyter notebook explores various techniques that can be used to fool image classifiers. We use the VGG-16 network, which will predict what an object in an image is from 1000 possible classes.
The aim of this work is to modify an image of a coffee mug, such that to a human it is still recognisable, but the network will mis-classify the image.

This piece of work was produced for a class assignment.
